# RESTful API + Fetch Test 
This project was a quick review on making a RESTful API using express.JS as well as a fetch test.

## here we go:  
- install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you haven't already
- git clone this repo to your machine
- in a terminal window, navigate into that folder (should be named refresher-create-rest-api-and-fetch-test)
- type and enter each one of the following into the terminal window:
  ``` 
  npm install
  node index.js
  ```
## to test the api
- on your browser, take yourself to http://localhost:3000
  - or if you're feeling fancy, open up another (different) terminal window
  - in that window, verify that you're in this repo's folder (if not, navigate yourself to it)
  - type  ``` node apiCall.js ``` into the terminal's window
- boom, a random number between 1 and 3 is returned from the API

good fun. cheers.
